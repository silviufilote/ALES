# ALES
##  RLS (Recursive Least Squares) vs LS (Least Squares)
   LS updates the estimate using a batch approch instead RLS uses a recursive update

##  Adaptive RLS and Least Mean Squares (LMS)
   Adaptive RLS (Forgetting Factor): An algorithm for dynamic system parameter estimation, adapting to changing conditions by emphasizing recent data.
   LMS (Least Mean Squares): An iterative method for real-time parameter adjustment, minimizing mean square error in applications like filtering and equalization.
